## Overview

It is a project I developed to try to create paths using Bezier Curves. I made this project to understand how the curve system works in unity. I later converted the project into a road drawing system, but I can't share it here as I don't own all the intellectual rights.

This project is at least a starting point for creating curved roads.

## Features

**Control points:** Determines how many lanes the road will have.  
**Distance:** Determines the distance between the points, according to this distance the points are placed.  
**Count:** Determines the number of points in each lane.  
**Modes:** Select the mode according to Distance or Count and the series will be created.

## Results

I learned about basic curve systems and path systems and gained an introductory level of knowledge. I then developed and expanded this project into a path drawing program that can be used in a professional environment. You can watch a small demo in the video below.
